/*
1. Create a function, joinStrings, that accepts 2 strings and joins them using the + operator. (this is known as string concatenation), returning the result.
*/ 

/* 
2. Call joinStrings 3 separate times -- the first time sending 1 argument, the second time sending 2 strings, and the third time sending 3 strings. What happens?
*/

/*
3. Fix this code so that it returns "This is a messed-up...function, yo"
*/ 

function fixMe (
  let str: This is a messed-up...;
  return: {str};
  str + str + "function, yo";
);

/*
4. Write a function, squareNumber, that accepts a number and returns the result of multiplying it by itself (known as squaring the number).
