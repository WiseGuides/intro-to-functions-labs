/*
1. Create a function, joinStrings, that accepts 2 strings and joins them using the + operator. (this is known as string concatenation), returning the result.
*/ 

/* 
2. Call joinStrings 3 separate times -- the first time sending 1 argument, the second time sending 2 strings, and the third time sending 3 strings. What happens?
*/

/*
3. Fix this code so that it returns "This is a messed-up...function, yo"
*/ 

function fixMe (
  let str: This is a messed-up...;
  return: {str};
  str + str + "function, yo";
);

/*
4. When functions specify parameters (arguments they accept), they can be given a default value (in case the argument isn't passed in). Example:

greet(language="English") {
  // will use specified language if one was passed in, else used the default "English"
}

Create a function, greet, that accepts a parameter, name. Default name to "friend".
*/

/*
5. Time to experiment: what if you have a function with 2 parameters and only one is passed in? Is it possible to reliably use default values in this case?
*/

/*
6. Write a function, squareNumber, that accepts a number and returns the result of multiplying it by itself (known as squaring the number).
*/

/*
7. Write a function, addNumbers, that takes 2 number arguments, adds them, calls squareNumber, and returns the results.
*/

/*
8. Call addNumbers. Does it work as you expected? (For example, if you passed 2 and 3, it should return the number 25)
